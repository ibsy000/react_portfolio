                <h5>Wanna get to know me personally?</h5>
                <p>I'm like a variety pack of chips. There are so many
                    things I'm into. Like a dodecahedron I've also got 
                    many sides: nerdy, dorky, sporty, outdoorsy, artsy,
                    punny, perky, earthy, trustworthy, adventurous, and 
                    so on. I want to travel and see all the beauty this 
                    world has to offer. I like camping, hiking, canoeing,
                    playing tennis, softball, football, soccer, frisbee, and
                    basketball. My truck is packed and ready for anything!
                    I like board games, card games, video games, virtual
                    reality, ping pong, billiards, darts, cornhole and so
                    many other fun activities. I nerd out over superheroes,
                    collectibles, comic books, anime, manga, and anything 
                    cute and adorable!
