                <h5>What brought me to my current career path?</h5>
                <p>I often get called "tech support" because of my 
                    innate ability to understand technology, applications, 
                    and programs. Family, friends, co-workers, and 
                    sometimes even strangers come to me when they need help.
                    The opportunity to learn web development fell on my
                    lap at the right moment when I was looking for 
                    something new. I love how you can take an idea and
                    turn it into reality or find a problem and solve it!
                    I enjoy every part of the development process and have
                    fun doing what I do. I couldn't be more excited about
                    starting my new career in the field of technology.
